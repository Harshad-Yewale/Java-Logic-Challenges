<h1>🔥 Java Logic Building Practice</h1>

<h2>📌 About This Repository</h2>
<p>
This repository is created to improve my <strong>Java logical thinking and problem-solving skills</strong>.
I am practicing questions based on <strong>Core Java fundamentals</strong> such as conditional statements,
loops, recursion, arrays, strings, and combined logical challenges.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this repository is to build strong logic before moving into 
<strong>DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)</strong> and competitive coding. 
I will be solving questions gradually and updating my solutions here in Java.
</p>

<p>
All the questions are taken from a PDF guide named <em>Master Your Logic Building (Before Starting DSA)</em>, 
which contains structured phases and levels of logical problems.
